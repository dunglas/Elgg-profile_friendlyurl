   You can add a Bind entry like: *.example.com.   3600 IN  CNAME 10 www.example.com.
2. If you are using Apache virtual hosts, add every subdomains to the Elgg vhost like this:
    <VirtualHost *>
      ServerName example.com
      ServerAlias *.punxrezo.net
      [...]
    </VirtualHost>
3. Backup then replace the .htaccess file in the your root Elgg directory by the htaccess-dist file of the plugin directory.
   Edit this new .htaccess file and replace all occurrences of "example.com" by something like "yourdomain.com".
